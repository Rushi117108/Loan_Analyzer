# Loan_Analyzer  
Hi âœ‹!
A bank loan analyzer helps in evaluating the creditworthiness of loan applicants. It considers various financial factors such as income, credit history and debt-to-income ratio.  
Analyzing loan applications manually can be time-consuming and prone to errors. A loan analyzer automates the process, making it more efficient and reducing the time required to make lending decisions.
